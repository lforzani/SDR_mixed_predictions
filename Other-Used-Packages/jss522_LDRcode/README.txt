- DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a toolkit for sufficient dimension reduction running on MATLAB. It mainly
implements likelihood-based methods for normal models.

Available methods include:
 - Isotonic Principal Fitted Components (Cook 2007)
 - Extended Principal Fitted Components (Cook 2007)
 - Principal Fitted Components (Cook and Forzani 2009a)
 - Structured Principal Fitted Components (Cook and Forzani 2009a)
 - Covariance Reduction models (Cook and Forzani 2008)
 - Likelihood Acquired Directions (Cook and Forzani 2009b)
 - Envelope Models for Multivariate Linear Regression (Cook, Li and Chiaromonte 2009)
 
 Other dimension reduction methods are supplied for completness:
 - Principal Components
 - Partial Least Squares
 - Sliced Inverse Regression
 - Sliced Average Variance Estimator
 - Directed Regression
 



CONTENTS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-MAIN:

   - ldr.m: an interface function for command-line operation.
   - setpaths.m: a start up function to add all the folders in the package to 
   Matlab's search path. 

   # ./TOOLS: auxiliary routines used by the method-specific functions and procedures for managing data, results and plots.

   # ./TOOLBOXES: third-party toolkits used in the LDR package. It includes the 
   SG_MIN package by R. Lippert and the LIGHTSPEED toolkit by T. Minka. The supplied version of SG_MIN is slightly modified with respect to the original.

   # ./MODELS: model-specific functions including objective function, derivative 
   and methods for estimation of the dimension reduction subspace.

   # ./PAPERS: a collection of scripts to reproduce the examples for the paper in the Journal of
 Statistical Software and other reported results for likelihood-based sufficient dimension reduction.
 
   # ./GUI: functions used by the graphical user interface.


INSTALLATION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The LDR package requires installation of the LIGHTSPEED TOOLKIT. This allows for using compilled routines that speed up many computations. See installation details in the ./PAPERS/LIGHTSPEED folder. If you already have this toolkit installed in your machine, yo do not have to install it again.

After installation of LIGHTSPEED, the LDR package runs as a local folder and does not need installation.


USAGE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   - To start using the toolkit, you must run first >> setpaths
     This will make all functions in the package available at Matlab's search path. 
   - Function ldr provides the interface to run likelihood-based dimension reduction methods from the command line.

   - demo is little Graphical User Interface to run simple computations using LDR interactively.
